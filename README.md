# Interpolations
Some Py scripts to perform interpolations.

Those scripts are " pulg and play". In fact, you only need to copy it in your own code and then call the "process" functions with your support points and corresponding values and then plot the output fo the function and there you have it!

Here you can see an example of a Lagrange Interpolation for the following values: 

support = [0,3,7,10]
values = [1,2,0.5,4]
